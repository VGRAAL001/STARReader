        <h2>About STAR Reader</h2>
        <p>
            STAR aims to deliver a complete system that enables visually impaired learners to confidently write their matric examinations
            without assistance. The proposed system offers a transformative solution to the challenges faced by impaired students, especially during examinations.
            Leveraging advanced AI technology and additional platforms, the system provides real-time assistance in reading examination content using a tablet
            and audio device, eliminating the need for manual assistance from a reader. By utilizing the technologies put forward, selected exam questions are
            instantly vocalized to the students in a non-robotic voice, enabling them to navigate and engage with the content independently. Additionally, the
            multilingual support enhances the usability and inclusivity of the system where English and Afrikaans are at the forefront, ensuring a tailored
            examination experience for every student. Essentially, our system is a paradigm shift in the field of educational accessibility. We want to
            empower visually impaired students to overcome obstacles and establish a more equal and inclusive educational environment where all students,
            regardless of reading disability or difficulty, can reach their full academic potential. Overall, STAR Reader aims to streamline the examination process,
            promote accessibility, and empower visually impaired students to excel academically with confidence and independence.

            <h3>AI-Assisted Learning Tools</h3>
            <p>
                Using Azure AI Speech, our platform will be able to accurately scan assessments questions from digital papers thanks to its text-to-speech technology.
                Through seamless integration with tactile interfaces and screen readers,
                the system vocalizes the questions instantaneously, making it possible for students with visual difficulties to access and comprehend with ease.

                Our system provides extensive language support. Our system enables examination questions to be heard aloud in different South African languages and accents.
                This will enable students to engage with exam content in their preferred accent, thereby improving comprehension and performance.
                The system will be able to read other languages like Afrikaans and Zulu.
